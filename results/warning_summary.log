WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net u_top_DH/u_ctl_duck/duck_x_nxt_reg[9]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_top_DH/u_ctl_duck/duck_x_nxt_reg[9]_i_2/O, cell u_top_DH/u_ctl_duck/duck_x_nxt_reg[9]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.

WARNING: [DRC REQP-1840] RAMB18 async control check: The RAMB18E1 u_top_DH/u_draw_overlay/u_font_rom/char_pixels_reg has an input control pin u_top_DH/u_draw_overlay/u_font_rom/char_pixels_reg/ADDRARDADDR[13] (net: u_top_DH/u_draw_overlay/u_font_rom/ADDRARDADDR[10]) which is driven by a register (u_top_DH/u_draw_overlay/u_delay/delay_stage[1].del_mem_reg[1][33]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
