----IMPLEMENTATION----
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net u_top_DH/u_ctl_duck/duck_vertical_speed_nxt__0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_top_DH/u_ctl_duck/duck_vertical_speed_nxt_reg[4]_i_1/O, cell u_top_DH/u_ctl_duck/duck_vertical_speed_nxt_reg[4]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net u_top_DH/u_ctl_duck/duck_x_nxt_reg[10]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_top_DH/u_ctl_duck/duck_x_nxt_reg[10]_i_2/O, cell u_top_DH/u_ctl_duck/duck_x_nxt_reg[10]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net u_top_DH/u_ctl_duck/state_nxt__0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_top_DH/u_ctl_duck/FSM_sequential_state_nxt_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell u_top_DH/u_ctl_duck/FSM_sequential_state_nxt_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
