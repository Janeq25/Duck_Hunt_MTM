----IMPLEMENTATION----
ERROR: [Place 30-69] Instance btnC_IBUF_inst (IBUF driven by I/O terminal btnC) is unplaced after IO placer
ERROR: [Place 30-575] Sub-optimal placement for a clock-capable IO pin and MMCM pair. If this sub optimal condition is acceptable for this design, you may use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint in the .xdc file to demote this message to a WARNING. However, the use of this override is highly discouraged. These examples can be used directly in the .xdc file to override this clock rule.
	ERROR: The above is also an illegal clock rule
ERROR: [Place 30-68] Instance btnC_IBUF_inst (IBUF) is not placed
ERROR: [Place 30-99] Placer failed with error: 'IO Clock Placer failed'
Please review all ERROR, CRITICAL WARNING, and WARNING messages during placement to understand the cause for failure.
ERROR: [Common 17-69] Command failed: Placer could not place all instances
