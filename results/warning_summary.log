WARNING: [DRC REQP-1840] RAMB18 async control check: The RAMB18E1 u_top_DH/u_draw_overlay/u_font_rom/char_pixels_reg has an input control pin u_top_DH/u_draw_overlay/u_font_rom/char_pixels_reg/ADDRARDADDR[13] (net: u_top_DH/u_draw_overlay/u_font_rom/ADDRARDADDR[10]) which is driven by a register (u_top_DH/u_draw_overlay/u_delay/delay_stage[1].del_mem_reg[1][14]) that has an active asychronous set or reset.
