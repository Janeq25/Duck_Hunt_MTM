----IMPLEMENTATION----
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net u_top_DH/u_ctl_duck/duck_x_nxt_reg[9]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_top_DH/u_ctl_duck/duck_x_nxt_reg[9]_i_2/O, cell u_top_DH/u_ctl_duck/duck_x_nxt_reg[9]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
