WARNING: [DRC REQP-1840] RAMB18 async control check: The RAMB18E1 u_top_DH/u_draw_overlay/u_font_rom/char_pixels_reg has an input control pin u_top_DH/u_draw_overlay/u_font_rom/char_pixels_reg/ADDRARDADDR[10] (net: u_top_DH/u_draw_overlay/u_font_rom/ADDRARDADDR[7]) which is driven by a register (u_top_DH/u_player2_score0/FSM_sequential_state_reg_reg[1]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.

This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
WARNING: [DRC REQP-1840] RAMB18 async control check: The RAMB18E1 u_top_DH/u_draw_overlay/u_font_rom/char_pixels_reg has an input control pin u_top_DH/u_draw_overlay/u_font_rom/char_pixels_reg/ADDRARDADDR[9] (net: u_top_DH/u_draw_overlay/u_font_rom/ADDRARDADDR[6]) which is driven by a register (u_top_DH/u_player2_score2/FSM_sequential_state_reg_reg[1]) that has an active asychronous set or reset.
